# Boss Fight Game

### by Marcus Thoen

## Introduction

Boss Fight Game is a simple fighting game where the player fights a boss. The boss has 3 unique attacks that are randomly selected as the fight goes on. The player has access to two attacks - a melee attack that is usable any time, and a spell attack that is usable after the player has hit at least 3 melee attacks. The fight ends when either the player or boss dies.

This project was made as part of the CPSC 210 class at UBC.
